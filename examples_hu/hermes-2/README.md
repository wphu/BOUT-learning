Installing BOUT++
=================

This version works with BOUT++ v4.2.2 or later

    git clone https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev.git
    cd BOUT-dev

To run this model, preconditioning is strongly recommended, and requires the CVODE solver, part of [SUNDIALS](http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials).
Tested with version 2.6.0. To enable CVODE, BOUT++ should be configured using

    ./configure --with-cvode

or

    ./configure --with-sundials

(which then also enables the IDA solver). Compile BOUT++ with

    make

Compiling Hermes
================

To compile, run "make" and specify the location of BOUT++
> $ make BOUT_TOP=/path/to/BOUT/
